# Hi, I’m Axel 👋

I’m a high school student interested in **aerospace engineering**, **physics**, and **computer science**.

I’m currently learning:
- Python for engineering simulations
- Computational physics
- Scientific programming

My goal is to use code to model and understand real physical systems, especially in aerospace applications.

📌 Current focus:
- CS50P (Harvard)
- Physics simulations in Python
- Improving my technical English

📂 Projects will be added progressively as I learn.
